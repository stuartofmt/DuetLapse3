## systemctl setup
 
This document briefly describes setting up a unit file so that a program will begin running after bootup.
Its accurate for Debian Buster but there may be differences for other distributions - so this documant is only guidance.

Download the appropriate **unit file** example<br>
These files have a .service extension
They are set in a way that will automatically restart the program if it is manually terminated or if it terminates because of a problem.
In other words - they are set to try and keep an instance of the program running at all times.

```
wget https://github.com/stuartofmt/DuetLapse3/raw/main/startDuetLapse3.service
```
or
```
wget https://github.com/stuartofmt/DuetLapse3/raw/main/DuetLapse3.service
```

Edit the example file paying particular attention to the following:
```
WorkingDir=/home/pi/Lapse
```
This needs to be the directory in which you have DuetLapse3.py installed **BUT** with fully qualified filenames.  If you are using startDuetLapse3.py it will be in the same directory as DuetLapse3. 
```
User=pi
```
Needs to be the usual login user

The ExecStart line is normally the same syntax as you would use to start the program.
You should have tested this from the command line and be confident that it works as you want.

**Example**
```
ExecStart=python3 /home/pi/Lapse/startDuetLapse3.py -port 8082
```
----
Determine where your systemctl files are. Usually this will be somewhere like /lib/systemd/system.<br>
This directory will be used in the following commands.

If your distribution does not use this directory, and you are unsure what it is - you can narrow down the options with:

```
sudo find / -name system | grep systemd
```

- [1]  copy the unit file (.service file) to the systemd directory 

example (change this depending on the name of your unit file)
```
sudo cp ./[your unit file name ].service /lib/systemd/system/[your unit file name ].service
```
- [2] change the ownership to root
example
```
sudo chown root:root /lib/systemd/system/[your unit file name].service
```

- [3]  relaod systemd daemon so that it recognizes the new file

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
- [4]  start the service

```
sudo systemctl start [your unit file name].service
```
- [5]  check for errors

```
sudo systemctl status [your unit file name].service
```

If there is an error - you can edit it in the /lib/systemd/system directory then repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 above.


Finally - enable the unit file, reboot and test to see if its running

```
sudo systemctl enable [your unit file name].service
```
